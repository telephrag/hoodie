This file contains build schema. 
It must have a name `build.json` which is hard-coded. 
Format is: ("%file.hoo%": "path/to/output/to.format")
"_" is for files with traits which are used only in compilation of other files.
As of now, if output path contains directory, 
said directory must exist prior to compilation.
NOTE: .hoo files must be specified only by their name
	"traits/os.hoo": "_" -- won't compile
    "os.hoo": "_"        -- ok
To find out how `hoodie` works take a look inside files listed above.

To compile project:
 - remove text outside of `{}` and rename this file to "build.json".
 - build hoodie or download executable from "releases" section
   at hoodie's github page
 - run executable with flag -d=path/to/project/directory
